# Todoist for GeekTool

Simple CLI script to show all tasks for Today.

# Usage

```python
python3 todoist-gk.py "YOUR-API-TOKEN".
```

Double-click `todoist-geektool.glet`.

# Future

Proof of concept, only tested on python3, and doesn't do much right now.

Future:
* More interesting filters
* Use Todoist's sync_token to make more responsive
* (Maybe) Use GeekTool's Weblet instead.
